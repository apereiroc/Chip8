    /**
     CHIP-8 specifications:
        * Memory:
            - RAM memory: it has 4 kB (4096 bytes) of RAM, from location 0x000 (0) to 0xFFF (4095).
                          The first 512 bytes, from 0x000 to 0x1FF, are where the original interpreter
                          was located, and should not be used by programs. This chip-8 starts at 0x200 (512).
            - Stack memory: it has 16 values of 16-bit, and stores the address that the interpreter should
                            return to when finished with a subroutine.
        * Registers:
            - 16 general purpose 8-bit registers, referred to as Vx (x = 0..F)
            - 1 16-bit register, I. Generally, it stores the memory addresses so only the lowest
                (rightmost) 12 bits are usually used.
        * Pseudo-registers:
            - 16-bit, Program Counter (PC). Stores the currently executing address.
            - 8-bit, Stack Pointer (SP). It is used to point to the topmost level of the stack.
